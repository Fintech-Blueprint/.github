# Fintech-Blueprint Clonable Org: Golden Template & CI/CD Gates Overview\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis repository set provides a clonable organization scaffold and a golden template microservice (`example-service`) intended to accelerate new service onboarding. It contains standardized CI/CD gates, shared libraries, governance ADRs, and GitOps manifests for staging.\n\n## Repo List\n\n- infra: Platform infrastructure, ADRs, and platform-level policies.\n- platform-libs: Shared libraries (auth, tracing, idempotency, outbox, utils).\n- contracts: API contract schemas and shared protobufs/openapi.\n- concierge: Service that coordinates onboarding and infra tasks.\n- db-manager: Database lifecycle and migrations service.\n- api-gateway: Edge routing and request orchestration.\n- catalog: Service catalog and metadata.\n- design-system: Shared UI components (storybook, tokens).\n- example-service: Golden template microservice (FastAPI) with CI/CD.\n- .github: Organization-level GitHub assets (workflows, runbooks, dependabot).\n\n## Golden Template Usage (example-service)\n\n1. Clone the repo:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:Fintech-Blueprint/example-service.git\ncd example-service\n```\n\n2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:\n\n```bash\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n3. Run locally:\n\n```bash\nuvicorn src.application.main:app --reload --port 8000\n# then open http://localhost:8000/healthz\n```\n\n4. Build and run with Docker:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t example-service:local .\ndocker run -p 8000:8000 example-service:local\n```\n\n5. Deploy to staging (via GitOps): create a branch, update manifests under `k8s/` and open a PR targeting `main`.\n\n## CI/CD Gates\n\n- Unit Tests: Runs `pytest` unit suite; must pass before merging.\n- Contract Tests: Validates OpenAPI/contract compatibility with shared schemas.\n- Lint: Runs `flake8`/`ruff` and enforces style rules.\n- SAST: Static application security scans (e.g., bandit, semgrep).\n- Docker Build: Confirms container builds successfully and validates multi-stage cache.\n- SBOM & Signing: Generates SBOM and runs image signing (cosign) as part of release pipeline.\n- Staging Canary: Deploys changes to the `staging-env` ArgoCD application for canary verification.\n\nEach PR is expected to pass all required checks listed above (see the branch protection runbook for exact status-check names).\n\n## Notes\n\n- Branch protection configuration was intentionally skipped and must be applied by an org admin. See `branch_protection_runbook.md` for exact `gh` CLI commands.\n- Secret scanning and certain enforcement features may require plan upgrades or web UI confirmation; validate in the org settings.\n- Some repository-level features (required signatures) are not included due to plan limitations.\n\n## Contact / Support\n\n- Default platform admin contact: `platform-admins@fintech-blueprint.example` (replace with your support alias).\n- For emergency access, contact org-admins via the GitHub org team or directly reach out to `security@fintech-blueprint.example`.\n
